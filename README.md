# F25ProbProject
There's this frog... We can't stop him. Save Lilypad Society 

Project Description: 
Let there be a frog N hops away from the final destination 

For every hop, the frog looks at every location in front of it and chooses with equal probability 
where to land. The frog repeats this process until he reaches his final destination. 

Let X represent the number of hops it takes the frog to reach his final destination. 
X is a random variable since we can't explicitly say how many hops it'll take the frog. 
The only thing we can say about X is that it's a number 1 to N inclusive. 

This simulation will empirically approximate the answers to some questions. 
1. When N = 10, what is the probability that it takes the frog 3 jumps?
2. When N = 8, what is the PMF of X? What are the possible values of X and their respective probabilities? Plot this :(
3. When N = 20, what is the expected (average) number of jumps? Plot this :(
4. How does the expected (average) value of X change as N increases?
5. For the memes, the dreams, and the...
